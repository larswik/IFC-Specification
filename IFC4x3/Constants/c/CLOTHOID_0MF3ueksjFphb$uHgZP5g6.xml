	<Documentation>In the geometric perspective, a clothoid denotes a connection between two points where the radius of curvature changes along the segment at a constant rate. The clothoid was an early achievement of geometry, also known as Euler&apos;s spiral or Cornu&apos;s spiral. It became very popular in road and rail design even before the widespread availability of computers because of the availability of tabulations of the normalized clothoid. Proper application of the so called clothoid constant provided fast solutions for all relevant parameters necessary to integrate clothoid segments between two consecutive segments with constant curvature. In most cases the clothoid smooths the curvature between a straight line and a ciruclar arc. &lt;br/&gt;

In the dynamic perspective, it denotes a segment with constant rate of lateral acceleration change induced by the curvature. The kinematic properties of the clothoid both reduce the exerted forces on the track by a train, improve the travel experience of train passengers and also reduce the stress of a car driver by avoiding sudden movements of the steering wheel.&lt;br&gt;

The kinematic advantages of the clothoid as a smoothing segment are true also for all the other transition bends currently in use.
