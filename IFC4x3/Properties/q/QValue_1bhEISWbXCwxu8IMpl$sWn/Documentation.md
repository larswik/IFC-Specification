The rock mass quality (Q) is a very sensitive index and its value varies from 0.001 to 1000. Use of the Q-system is specifically recommended for tunnels and caverns with an arched roof.
The Q-value is determined with:
$$
Q = \frac{RQD}{Jn}*\frac{Jr}{Ja}*\frac{Jw}{SRF}
$$
The first term RQD (Rock Quality Designation) divided by Jn (joint set number) is related to the size of the intact rock blocks in the rock mass. The second term Jr (joint roughness number) divided by Ja (joint alteration number) is related to the shear strength along the discontinuity planes and the third term Jw (joint water parameter) divided by SRF (stress reduction factor) is related to the stress environment on the intact rock blocks and discontinuities around the underground excavation.

A multiplication of the three terms results in the Q parameter, which can range between 0.001 for an exceptionally poor to 1000 for an exceptionally good rock mass. The numerical values of the class boundaries for the different rock mass qualities are subdivisions of the Q range on a logarithmic scale.
