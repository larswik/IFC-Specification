			<Documentation>Long name for a spatial structure element, used for informal purposes. It should be used, if available, in conjunction with the inherited _Name_ attribute.
&gt; NOTE&amp;nbsp; In many scenarios the _Name_ attribute refers to the short name or number of a spacial element, and the _LongName_ refers to the full descriptive name.</Documentation>

			<Documentation>Set of spatial containment relationships, that holds those elements, which are contained within this element of the project spatial structure.
&gt; NOTE&amp;nbsp; The spatial containment relationship, established by _IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure_, is required to be an hierarchical relationship, where each element can only be assigned to 0 or 1 spatial structure element.</Documentation>

&gt; NOTE&amp;nbsp; The spatial reference relationship, established by _IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure_, is not required to be an hierarchical relationship, i.e. each element can be assigned to 0, 1 or many spatial structure elements.
