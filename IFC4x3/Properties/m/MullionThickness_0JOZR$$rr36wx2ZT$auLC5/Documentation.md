Thickness of the mullion.

For a window, it is the thickness of the mullion (i.e., the vertical separator of window panels within a window), measured parallel to the window elevation plane. The mullion is part of the lining and the mullion depth is assumed to be identical to the lining depth. If the MullionThickness is set to zero (and the MullionOffset set to a positive length), then the window is divided horizontally without a physical divider.
